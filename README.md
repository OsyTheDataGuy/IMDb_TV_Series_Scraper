# IMDb_TV_Series_Scraper
For this project, I will scrape the over 240,000 TV series on IMDb. 

Features I am interested in include: 
- title, 
- release date, 
- country, 
- rating, 
- number of voters, and 
- award wins and nominations. 

To do this, I'll be using the web-scraping framework, scrapy.
